# Vector Drift

*A Retro Revival Arcade Space Shooter*

## 🚀 About the Game

**Vector Drift** is a retro-inspired 2D arcade space shooter built in **GameMaker**. Inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit era arcade games, the project reimagines classic space combat with a **modern momentum-based movement system**. Instead of instant stopping and turning, players must master drift and inertia to survive.

This project was created for a **Video Game Design: Retro Revival** competition and uses **100% original assets**.
